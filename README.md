# Tropes & Schemes

## Overview

I'm trying to find a way of learning schemes and tropes, which rhetorical patterns in English. Many of these are known as figures of speech. Some are commonly known, like hyperbole, while others are more obscure, like hyperbaton and zeugma. I'd like to make all of this easier to learn and retain.

There are some good resources online for this, but overall I feel like this is not something a lot of people are interested in.

## Methods

I save data in `data.toml` and these are used to generate a deck for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), the flashcard learning app. The script `read.py` generates the deck.

My best source of information is the website [Silva Rhetoricae](http://rhetoric.byu.edu/), which is comprehensive but not always in-depth. I've found that the more examples you have, the better, so I try to supplement with examples from Wikipedia and myself. 

All of the data in `data.toml` is in the [TOML format](https://toml.io/en/). As long as the data is well-structured and well-populated with examples/quotes, I think I can generate a good Anki learning deck.

## To-do

The more quotes and examples, the better. The best way to learn is to see the schemes and tropes in different context.

Here is a list of card types that I think will be good to do.

- [ ] From the description/definition, name the trope/scheme (and vice-versa)
- [ ] From a single quote, name the scheme/trope (I would like a way for one quote to map to more than one trope/scheme)
- [ ] From a list of tropes/schemes belonging to a family, identify the family (and vice-versa)
